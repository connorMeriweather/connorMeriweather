- 👋 Hi, I’m @connorMeriweather
- 👀 I’m interested in Web 3.0 + blockchain development, mixed-martial arts, and nature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development (HTML, CSS, JS, NODE, MONGO DB, REACT.js, etc.) OOP, & how to use GitHub/stack overflow to navigate through my journey more efficiently :-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing... just learning for now!
- 📫 How to reach me: effortlessflowstate@gmail.com
